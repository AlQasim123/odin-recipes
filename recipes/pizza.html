    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Neapolitan pizza originated in Naples, Italy, hundreds of years ago. Why mess with a good thing? There is even an Italian non-profit organization—the True Neapolitan Pizza Association (Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana), or AVPN—which is dedicated entirely to protecting the integrity and tradition that go into an authentic Neapolitan pizza.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Mix flour, water, salt, and yeast together until the desired consistency is achieved. Then roll out into a disk</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Crush or slice your tomatoes, simmer with olive oil, and season appropriately while remembering that the beauty of this dish is simplicity</li>
        <li>Assemble the pizza: Spread your sauce and space mozzarella slices evenly around the surface area</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Tradition dictates that the cooking should be done in a high-heat oven for a very short period of time. It should also be cooked exclusively in a wood-fired oven, but I won’t tell if you won’t.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Garnish with fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
