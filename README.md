## What I Did

- **Simple Boilerplate**: I started with a basic boilerplate.
- **Organized Structure**: The project is set up with a straightforward and easy to understand file and folder structure.
- **Atomic Commits**: I focused on making small, frequent commits for nearly every change, keeping the commit history clean and understandable.
- **Optimized Images**: Free lightweight images are used, and their sources are clearly attributed.
- **Cohesive Design**: I put small effort into making the pages well-coordinated.
